        <h2>Why earthquakes?</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Peruvian student and back home it is usual to experiment a lot of seismic activity. Personally I have been through 4 big scale earthquakes and a lot of small ones as well.
            <br> One of the most memorable earthquakes was the one that happened on August 15th, 2007 at 6:41PM (Peruvian Time). I was currently living in the Ica city. Everything happened so fast.
            Thankfully my whole family was able to get together, leave the house and be safe. I remember this earthquake was a long one. It was about 2 minutes and there were too many aftershocks after that day.
            These are some images of the city after the earthquake happened.

            Here there is a USGS shakemap near the central coast of Peru indicated the approximate location of the epicenter of this earthquake of magnitude 8.0 in Rchter scale.
